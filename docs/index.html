== THE KERNEL AT A GLANCE


=== The design approach

====
_RK0 Blog_: https://kernel0.org/2025/05/16/about-processes-tasks-and-threads/[About Processes, Tasks and Threads]
====


==== Architecture

The layered architecture can be split -- roughly -- into two: a top and a bottom layer. On the top, the _Executive_ manages the resources needed by the application. 

On the bottom, the _Low-level Scheduler_ works as a software extension of the CPU.

Together, they implement the _Task_ abstraction. This primitive is the _Concurrency Unit_ and follows the _Thread_ model. A _Task_ is a _thread_.

In systems design jargon, the Executive enforces policy (what should happen). The Low-level Scheduler provides the mechanism (how it gets done). The services are the primitives that gradually translate policy decisions into concrete actions executed by the Scheduler.


RK0's goal is determinism on low-end devices. Its multitasking engine does not split user space from kernel space.
Tasks execute in privileged mode and use a dedicated process stack pointer, distinct from the system stack. The rationale:

	-	Application tasks are not unknown entities at run time.

	-	Implementing system calls as traps either forces a non-preemptive kernel, or increases complexity in critical paths, degrading determinism.
    
	-	Relying on the ARMv6/7-M MPU decreases memory usage efficiency and introduces latency on control paths. It does not fit RK0’s deterministic execution model.



==== Programming with RK0


====

[NOTE]

This document discusses the design internals, design choices and give usage examples. If not on actual usage examples, the text does not present the formal API, but simplifications. Code snippets might present outdated API.

The current API is found here:
https://github.com/antoniogiacomelli/RK0/blob/main/core/inc/kapi.h[RK0 API]
====


RK0 is designed so that it does not get in the programmer’s way. 

It aims to be transparent, composable, deterministic, and with clear semantics.

Transparent means that the kernel does not hide its primitives behind opaque pointers nor introduce unexpected side effects. 

Its components are composable because each feature is self-contained yet designed to work with others.

Clear semantics means mechanisms behave as expected across different usage patterns.

Determinism is pursued by avoiding execution paths whose worst case cannot be bounded or reasoned about in advance. 

When possible, operations are O(1), rely on word-aligned memory, and use static allocation.

When dynamic allocation is unavoidable, its worst-case behaviour can still be characterised offline (unless the application itself prevents any meaningful offline bound).
    
==== Suitable Applications


Given the architecture, _RK0_ targets applications with the following characteristics:

. They are designed to handle particular devices in which real-time responsiveness is imperative.
. Applications and middleware may be implemented alongside appropriate drivers.
. Drivers may even include the application itself.
. _Untested programs are not loaded_: After the software has been tested, it can be assumed reliable.

=== Kernel Services 

_RK0_ has _Core Services_ (always enabled) and optional services (enabled by configuration).

_Core Services_:

- Scheduler
- Partition Memory Allocator
- Timer Delays
- Task's Event Register

_Optional Services_

- Application Timer (Callouts)
- Sleep Queues 
- Counting/Binary Semaphores
- Mutex Semaphores
- Message Queue (and its extension Ports)
- Most-Recent Message Protocol (MRM)

When compiled with only _Core Services_, one gets a functional Executive with less than ~3 KB ROM.


== *Task Scheduler*

_RK0_ employs a priority-based preemptive scheduler, aligned with a Rate-Monotonic Assignment. Tasks are typically assigned priorities according to their request rates - i.e., tasks with shorter periods are assigned to higher priorities. The highest priority is represented by the value '0'; the lowest is represented by the value '31'.

====


An essential characteristic of the scheduler is that it is a _preemptive run-to-completion_ scheduler. This term, '_run-to-completion_' has slightly different meanings depending on the context. It is often related to strictly cooperative schedulers, in the sense 
tasks must _yield_ the processor. Otherwise, they monopolise the CPU. 


The Ready Queue table is an array of queues, which the index represents the 
priority

```
[][]...[] | Ready Tasks with Priority 31
[][]...[] 
[][]...[] 
     .
     .
     .
[][]...[] | Ready Tasks with Priority 0
```

In _RK0_, tasks with the same priority work cooperatively. This is different from schedulers that employ a _time-slice_ (quantum) for round-robin: after the slice expires, the task is put at the _tail_ of the _Ready Queue_.

The term _run-to-completion_ here is to be interpreted as follows:

- The scheduler's behaviour is to choose the highest priority READY task to run. Always.
- The scheduler works on a First-In-First-Out discipline for tasks with the same priority.
- A task must switch to the _READY_ state before being eligible for scheduling. 
- A task will switch from _RUNNING_ to _READY_ if yielding or if being preempted by a higher priority task. Otherwise it can only go to a _WAITING_ state, and eventually switch back to _READY_.
- When a task is preempted by a higher priority task, it switches from _RUNNING_ to _READY_ and is placed back on the _head_ position of its Ready Queue. This means that it will be resumed as soon as it is the highest priority ready task again. 
- On the contrary, if a task _yields_, it tells the scheduler it has completed its cycle. Then, it will be enqueued on the ready queue tail - the last queue position.
- When a task _waits_ it is suspended until a condition is satisfied.
- When the condition is satisfied, it switches from _WAITING_ to _READY_, and is enqueued on the tail.
- So, tasks with the same priority cooperate by either _yielding_ or _waiting_. 
- If a task never yields or waits, other tasks with the same or lower priority _will starve_.
- Finally, Tasks with the same priority are _initially_ placed on the _Ready Queue_ associated with that priority in the order they are _created_. 


[NOTE]
====
_RK0_ can handle context-switching with an extended frame when a float-point co-processor is available. This must be informed when compiling by defining the symbol `__FPU_PRESENT=1`.

===== Scheduler Design Internals

A notable scheduler characteristic is constant-time complexity (_O(1)_) with low latency. This was achieved by carefully composing the data structures and an efficient _'choose-next'_ algorithm, detailed below.

===== Scheduler Data Structures

====== Task Control Block

Every primitive is associated to a data structure we refer to as its _Control Block_. A Task Control Block is a record for stack, resources, and time management. The table below partially represents a Task Control Block (as this document is live, this might not reflect the exact fields of the current version).

[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
|Task Control Block
|Task name
|Task ID
|Status 
|Assigned Priority
|Effective Priority
|Saved Stack Pointer
|Stack Address
|Stack Size
|Event Register Control Block
|Last wake-time
|Next wake-time
|Time-out Flag
|Preemption Flag
|Owned Resources List
|Waiting Resources List
|Timeout List Node
|TCB List Node
|====================

Tasks are static -- they are not created (or destroyed) on runtime. There is no fork or join.

In practice, tasks are either _RUNNING_ or '_waiting_' for their turn to run. 


image::https://kernel0org.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/schdatastruct.png[width=90%]


We need to define  _WAITING_ and _READY_ clearly:

- A _READY_ task will be dispatched; therefore, switch to _RUNNING_ whenever it is the highest priority _READY_ task. 

- A WAITING task depends on a condition—generalised as an event—to transition to the READY state.

- Events that are not strictly time-related can be bounded by an upper limit of N ticks, or can be unbounded (the task waits indefinitely, i.e. “forever”). A task may also check for an event without blocking at all, using `try` semantics.

- Logically, the _WAITING_ state will assume different pseudo-states related to the kind of event that will switch a task to _READY_: 

- SLEEPING: the task is either waiting for an event associated with an `RK_SLEEP_QUEUE` object, or sleeping for a given amount of time with no explicit kernel object associated. The various `SLEEPING_*` states are explained throughout this document.

-  PENDING: the task has suspended itself, waiting for a combination of Event Flags on its Event Register. When this combination is satisfied, it switches to READY.

-  BLOCKED: the task is blocked on a mutex or semaphore. When a token becomes available, or the mutex is unlocked, it switches to READY.

- SENDING/RECEIVING: a producer task, when blocking on a Message Passing object, switches its status to SENDING; a consumer switches to RECEIVING. When, respectively, a slot or a message becomes available, the task switches to READY.
====
*_The scheduler rules, not the heap._*

_RK0_ tasks are static.

It’s a design decision rooted in real-time correctness.

Besides an application-specific system software does not need to treat tasks as 'unknown' objects. 


The wins:

* A memory layout the systems programmer knows.
* No alignment traps.
* Link-time visibility:
** Each task’s stack is a named symbol in the linker map.
** You can inspect and verify the memory layout before flashing. 
** A simple `objdump` reveals all stack allocations — that’s peace of mind.

====


====== Task Queues
The backbone of the queues where tasks will wait for their turn to run is a circular doubly linked list: removing any item from a double list takes O(1) (provided we don’t need to search the item). As the kernel knows each task’s address, adding and removing is always O(1). Singly linked lists can’t achieve O(1) for removal.

====== Ready Queue Table

Another design choice to achieve O(1) is the global ready queue, which is a table of FIFO queues—each queue dedicated to a priority—and not a single ordered queue. So, enqueuing a ready task is always O(1). Given the sorting needed, the time complexity would be O(n) if tasks were placed on a single ready queue.

====== Waiting Queues

The scheduler does not have a unique waiting queue. Every kernel object that can block a task has an associated waiting queue. Because these queues are a scheduler component, _they follow a priority discipline_: the highest priority task is dequeued first, _always_.

When an event capable of switching tasks from _WAITING_ to _READY_ happens, one or more tasks (depending on the mechanism) are then placed on the ready list, unique to their priority. Now, they are waiting to be picked by the scheduler—that is the definition of _READY_. 

====== The scheduling algorithm

As the ready queue table is indexed by priority - the index 0 points to the queue of ready tasks with priority 0, and so forth, and there are 32 possible priorities - a 32-bit integer can represent the state of the ready queue table. It is a BITMAP:

``` 

The BITMAP computation: ((1a) OR (1b)) AND (2), s.t.:

(1a) Every Time a task is readied, update: BITMAP |= (1U << task->priority );
(1b) Every Time an empty READY QUEUE becomes non-empty, update: BITMAP |= (1U << queueIndex)
(2): Every Time READY QUEUE becomes empty, update: BITMAP &= ~(1U << queueIndex);
EXAMPLE:

  Ready Queue Index :     (6)5 4 3 2 1 0
          Not empty :      1 1 1 0 0 1 0
                           ------------->
                 (LOW)  Effective Priority  (HIGH)
In this case, the scenario is a system with 7 priority task levels. Queues with priorities 6, 5, 4, and 1 are not empty.
```


Having the Ready Queue Table bitmap, we find the highest priority non-empty task list as follows:

(1) Isolate the *rightmost* '1':

```
RBITMAP = BITMAP & -BITMAP. (- is the bitwise operator for two's complement: ~BITMAP + 1) `
``` 

In this case:

``` 

                           [31]       [0]  :  Bit Position
                             0...1110010   :  BITMAP
                             1...0001110   : -BITMAP
                            =============
                             0...0000010   :  RBITMAP
                                     [1]
``` 

_The rationale here is that, for a number N, its 2’s complement -N, flips all bits - except the rightmost '1' (by adding '1') . Then, N & -N results in a word with all 0-bits except for the less significant '1'._

(2) Extract the *rightmost '1' _position_*:

- For ARMv7M, we benefit from the `CLZ` instruction to count the _leading zeroes_. As they are the number of zeroes on the left of the rightmost bit, '1', this value is subtracted from 31 to find the Ready Queue index. 

```C
RK_FORCE_INLINE static inline 
unsigned __getReadyPrio(unsigned readyQBitmap)
{
    unsigned ret;
    __ASM volatile (
        "clz    %0, %1     \n"
        "neg    %0, %0     \n"
        "add    %0, %0, #31\n"
        : "=&r" (ret)         
        : "r" (readyQBitmap)               
        :                      
    );
    return (ret);
}
``` 

This instruction would return #30, and #31 - #30 = #01 in the example above.


- For ARMv6M there is no suitable hardware instruction. The algorithm is written in C and counts the _trailing zeroes_, thus, the index number. Although it might vary depending on your compiler settings, it takes ~11 cycles (_note it is still O(1)_):

== Timers and Delays

=== Busy delay

A busy-wait delay `kBusyDelay(t)` keeps a task spinning for `t` ticks. That is, the task does nothing but does not suspend or yield (but can be preempted). This service finds its use when simulating workloads.

[TIP]
====

Context switching is probably the most significant overhead on a kernel. The time spent on the System Tick handler contributes to much of this overhead.

Design Choice: 

- Timers are kept on a single list; only the head element needs to be updated using a delta-queue approach. 

- Application Timers that trigger callbacks are run on a deferred, non-preemptible system task.

Benefits: 

- Keep the overhead of updating timers as minimal as possible with the delta queue; 

- Deferring the Application Timer to a high-priority, non-preemptible system task meet the requested callback period while keeping the ability to track system ticks.
====


[width="100%",options="header"]
|===============================
|Timeout Node
|Timeout Type
|Absolute Interval (Ticks)
|Relative Interval (Ticks)
|Waiting Queue Address
|Next Timeout Node
|Previous Timeout Node
|===============================

Every task is prone to events triggered by timers described in this section. Every Task Control Block has a node to _a timeout list_.
This list is doubly linked treated a delta-sequence. 

A set `T~set~  = {(T1,8), (T2,6), (T3,10)}` will be started at a relative time `0` as a sequence `T~seq~  = <(T2,6), (T1,2), (T3,2)>`. 

Thus, for every system tick, only the head element on the list needs to be decreased -- yielding O(1) on _decreasing_, that happens on the Hardware interrupt for the _System Tick_.

The ordering for the delta-queue is not O(1), it is O(n).  A decrease happens on every SysTick interrupt; and the ordering happens only when adding a new node  to the list.

=== Sleep Timers

There are three `sleep` primitives in RK0 -- they behave differently.

==== Sleep Delay
The `sleepdelay()` (aliased as `sleep()`) puts a  task to sleep for the exact number of `t` ticks on every call -- no matter when the last call has happened.

_Example_:
```C
VOID Task1(VOID* args)
{
    RK_UNUSEARGS
    UINT count = 0;
    while (1)
    {

        logPost("Task1: sleep");
        kSleep(300);
        /* wake here */
        count += 1U;
        if (count >= 5)
        {
            kDelay(25); /* spin */
            count=0;
            /* every 5 activations there will be a drift */
        }
    }
}
```
Output:
```
0 ms :: Task1: sleep
300 ms :: Task1: sleep  <-- +300
600 ms :: Task1: sleep  <-- +300
900 ms :: Task1: sleep  <-- +300
1200 ms :: Task1: sleep <-- +300
1525 ms :: Task1: sleep <-- +325
1825 ms :: Task1: sleep <-- +300 
2125 ms :: Task1: sleep <-- +300
2425 ms :: Task1: sleep
2725 ms :: Task1: sleep
3050 ms :: Task1: sleep
3350 ms :: Task1: sleep
3650 ms :: Task1: sleep
3950 ms :: Task1: sleep
4250 ms :: Task1: sleep
4575 ms :: Task1: sleep
```

==== Compensated Sleep Delays

These are suspensions that recompute the time considering the drift between calls. They are typically used to create periodic tasks with explicit periods. 
The general pattern is:

```C
VOID Task(VOID *args)
{
    <initialisation>
    
    while(1)
    {
        <periodic code>; /* this has an execution time */
        scheduleNext(PERIOD); /* cycle is finished: compute delay to keep PERIOD */
    }
}
```
The RMS algorithm considers all tasks have a common phase grid, that is when they are made READY, or are eligible to be scheduled. 
This means that from the very first activation, the time elapsed is already take into account to when the next release should happen.

Nevertheless, it is common for kernels to provide sleep primitives that take into account a local anchor time normally set on the `<initialisation>` code -- and will work as `waitUntil(&anchor, PERIOD)`. RK0 provides both, and they suit different cases, as exposed below.


[#sleeptimers]
===== Periodic Release Sleep 

`sleeprelease(P)` is used to delay a task so it is released on periodic rate.
The sleep time is recalculated by the kernel on every call. 

If the task wakes late by `N` ticks with `0 < N < P`, the kernel compensates by scheduling the next wake earlier (shortening the next sleep) so that over two periods the phase is preserved:

Say a task is expected to return from its `k~eth~` sleep at `T~k+1~ = T~k~ + P [ticks]`. If the task is resumed at `T~k+1~ = T~k~ + P + N`, upon detecting this drift, the kernel sets: `(T~k+2~ = T~k+1~ + P - N)` for `N < P`. 

This can be rewritten as: 

`(T~k+2~ = T~k~ + P + N + P - N) <-->
(T~k+2~ - T~k~ = 2P)`

_Example:_

```C

VOID Task1(VOID* args)
{
    RK_UNUSEARGS
    UINT count = 0;
    while (1)
    {
    
       logPost("Task1 released.");

        count += 1U;
        if (count >= 5)
        {
            kDelay(25); /* spin */
            count=0;
        }

        kSleepRelease(300); /*P=300 ticks; tick=1ms*/
    
        
    }
}
```

Output:

```   
.
.

/* R is release time */

.
```


This mechanism is phase-locked. When the lateness is greater or equal to `P` it _skips_ one or more releases to stay locked to the phase grid. In some sense, the `period` value can be seen as a _deadline_ -- if not met, the scheduler rejects to run on that activation. 

`sleeprelease()` makes easier to perform worst-response time analysis on periodic tasks.

[IMPORTANT]
A set of periodic tasks must have priorities assigned properly (highest request rate, highest priority -- the lower the period, the higher the priority). For `sleeprelease()` this is mandatory given the common phase grid.


===== Sleep Until (local anchor base)

`sleepuntil(anchor, period)` is somehow similar to `sleeprelease()`, but differs in two important aspects:

- The reference used to calculate how long to suspend to keep its rate is local to each task. It means the time before the first time the task is dispatched is dismissed.

- A late release longer than 1 period will return and run immediately. It prioritises execution count within a time-window - not the phase across releases.

---

The snippet belows clearly demonstrates how each mechanism handles lateness that are longer than 1 period:

```c

/* Every 3rd call both tasks will add up a delay longer than the task's period */

VOID HTask(VOID* args) /* higher priority: Period is 300 ticks */
{
    RK_UNUSEARGS
    UINT count = 0;
    while (1)
    {

        logPost("Higher: begin\r\n");
        /* wake here */
        count += 1U;
        kDelay(5);
        if (count >= 3)
        {
            kSleep(400); /* suspend */
            count=0;
        }
        logPost("Higher: end\r\n");
        kSleepRelease(300); 

    }
}


VOID LTask(VOID *args) /* lower priority: Period is 400 ticks */
{
    RK_UNUSEARGS
    RK_TICK anchor = kTickGet();
    UINT count=0;
    while (1)
    {
  
        logPost("Lower: begin\r\n");
        /* wake here */
        count += 1U;
        kDelay(5);
        if (count >= 3)
        {
            kSleep(500); 
            count=0;
        }
        logPost("Lower: end\r\n");
        kSleepUntil(&anchor, 400); 
    }
}
```
Output:
```c
       0 ms :: Higher: begin
       5 ms :: Higher: end
       5 ms :: Lower: begin
      10 ms :: Lower: end

[TIP]
One normally does not write a code with periodic tasks expecting they will
not keep their rate. But on the field a transient overload might cause it to
happen. If it does, you choose the policy that is best-fit for your task: preserve phase (skip) or preserve execution count.


=== Blocking Time-out

These are internal timers associated with kernel calls that are blocking. Thus, establishing an upper-bound waiting time might benefit them. When the time for unblocking is up, the kernel call returns, indicating a timeout. This value is passed as a number of ticks.

When blocking is associated with a kernel object (other than the Task Control Block), the timeout node will store the object waiting for queue's address, so it can be removed if time expires.

A kernel call is made non-blocking, that is _try semantics_, by assigning the value `RK_NO_WAIT`, the function returns immediately if unsuccessful.
The value `RK_WAIT_FOREVER` suspends a task indefinitely until the condition is satisfied. 
Timeout values above `RK_MAX_PERIOD` are invalid.

In practice, we often block either using `RK_WAIT_FOREVER` or do not block (_try semantics_, `RK_NO_WAIT`).

Use a bounded timeout only when you expect occasional misses and you know how to handle them.

[WARNING]
====
Importantly, _an ISR shall *never* block_. Any blocking call from an ISR is invalid and triggers fault handling when error checking is enabled.

[#callouttimers]
=== Callout Timers (Application Timers)

[width="100%",options="header"]
|===============================
|Timer Control Block
|Option: Reload/One-Shot
|Phase (Initial Delay)
|Callout Function Pointer
|Callout Argument
|Timeout Node
|===============================


These are Application Timers that will issue a callback when expiring.
In addition to a callout function, an Application Timer receives an initial phase delay and a period and can choose to run once (one-shot) or auto-reload itself.

The callback runs within a System Task with priority 0 and is non-preemptible, which makes the scheduler prioritise it over other tasks. Callouts must be short and unblocking, as they can cause high CPU contention.

Application Timers (with autoreload) will keep track of delays in between activations.


[#systick]
=== System Tick

A dedicated peripheral that generates an interrupt after a defined period provides the kernel time reference. For ARMv6/7M, this peripheral is the built-in SysTick, a 24-bit counter timer. 
The handler performs some housekeeping on every tick and assesses the need to call a context switch.

The 'housekeeping' accounts for global timer tracking and any tick-dependent condition that might change a task status.
When a timer expires, it may switch a task from `WAITING` to `READY` or schedule a callback. For callbacks, execution is deferred to the `PostProcSysTask` system task, where callbacks run and timer state is updated.

Note that tasks might switch from `WAITING` to `READY` for reasons other than tick-related. In these cases, context switching might be triggered immediately if the readied task can preempt the running task.

[#systask]
=== System Tasks

System Tasks are tasks that perform housekeeping/system related procedures outside interrupt handlers. 

Currently there are two the _Idle Task_ and the _PostProcSysTask_.

The _PostProcSysTask_ is used to execute _Application Timer_ callbacks and deferred some other deferred procedures such as the broadcast signals on Sleep Queues or Semaphores when issued from ISRs. The idea is the same, keep ISR shorts. It does not mean that this task can be expensive though because, _it cannot be preempted_ by user tasks, so timer callouts must be short. 

[WARNING]
Keep application timer callbackks minimal and non blocking. Avoid flushing from ISR.

The _Idle Task_ runs whenever there is no other ready task to be dispatched. The CPU enters on _low-power_.  If `RK_CONF_MIN_PRIO` is set to 31 -- and it can even if not all priorities are occupied (noting there will be a small memory overhead) -- the IdleTask is dispatched when the Ready bitmap is 0x00000000.




== Memory Allocator

[width="100%",options="header"]
|===============================
|Memory Allocator Control Block
|Associated Block Pool
|Number of Blocks
|Block Size
|Number of Free Blocks
|Free Block List
|===============================

The standard C library `malloc()`  leads to fragmentation and (also, because of that) is highly indeterministic. Unless we use it once - to allocate memory before starting up, it doesn’t fit. But often, we need to 'multiplex' memory amongst tasks over time, that is, to dynamically allocate and deallocate.

To avoid fragmentation, we use fixed-size memory blocks. A simple approach would be a static table marking each block as free or taken. With this pattern, you will need to 'search' for the next available block, if any - the time for searching changes - bounding this search to a maximum number of blocks, or _O(n)_.
To optimise, an approach is to keep track of what is free using a dynamic table—a linked list of addresses. Now we have _O(1)_.

We use "meta-data" to initialise the linked list. Every address holds the "next" address value. All addresses are within the range of a pool of fixed-size blocks.
This approach limits the minimal size of a block to the size of a memory address—32 bits for our supported architecture. 

Yet, this is the cheapest way to store meta-data. If not stored on the empty address itself, an extra 32-bit variable would be needed for each block, so it could have a size of less than 32 bits.

[TIP]
=====
Allocating memory at runtime is a major source of latency (1), indeterministic (2) behaviour, and footprint overhead (3).

Design choice: the allocator's design achieves low-cost, deterministic, fragmentation-free memory management by using fixed-size word-aligned block sizes (1)(2) and embedding metadata within the memory blocks themselves (3).

Benefits: Run-time memory allocation benefits have no real-time drawbacks. 
=====


[NOTE]
The kernel will always round up the block size to the next multiple of 4. Say the user creates a memory pool, assigning blocks to be 6-byte wide; they will turn into 8-byte blocks.

=== How it works

When a routine calls `alloc()`, the address to be returned is the one a "free list" is pointing to, say `addr1`. Before returning `addr1` to the caller, we update the free list to point to the value stored within `addr1` - say `addr8` at that moment.

When a routine calls `free(addr1)`, we overwrite whatever has been written in addr1 with the value-free list point to (if no more `alloc()` were issued, it would still be `addr8`), and `addr1` becomes the free list head again.

Allocating and deallocating fixed-size blocks using this structure and storing meta-data this way is as deterministic (_O(1)_) and economical as we can get for dynamic memory allocation.

====


Inter-Task Communication (ITC) refers to the mechanisms that enable tasks to coordinate/cooperate/synchronise by means of sending or receiving information that falls into two logical categories: _Signals_ or _Messages_. 

* *__Signals__*: A _Signal is either present or absent_. Its meaning is implicit.

* *__Messages__*: A _Message_ is a means of coordinating and exchanging information altogether. Different from a _Signal_, a Message needs to be parsed. 

[TIP]
Semantics for inter-task communication is a design concern when targeting predicatibility. For this reason, some mechanisms that on the surface can be seen as 'too high-level' for a lean kernel, as PORTS or the MRM Protocol, are offered as primitives because through semantics they enforce policy that meet real-time demands.

[#directsignals]
=== Task Events (Task Event Flags)

[width="100%",options="header"]
|===============================
|Within Task Control Block
|Event Register (32 flags)
|Required Signal Flags
|Options (ALL/ANY)
|===============================

Each Task Control Block stores a 32-bit event register (one event per bit). 
The API is bit-mask oriented:

- `set(task, mask)` posts flags with OR semantics.

- `get(mask)` waits until the required pattern is met.e When successful the matched required positions are cleared from the task event register, optionally stored on an address passed by the getter. 
If choosing not to wait it returns immediately with a positive return code.

- `query()` reads current flags.

- `clear(mask)` clears selected flags.

`0x00` is invalid as a `set()` mask and as `required` for `get()`.


[#supervisortask]
===== Usage Example: Supervisor Task 


One common pattern is to start each loop by checking pending events. In a supervisor task, this becomes an event hub.

```C

/* events */
#define CO2_HIGH_EVENT           RK_EVENT_01
#define O2_LOW_EVENT             RK_EVENT_02
#define HUM_HIGH_EVENT           RK_EVENT_03
#define TEMP_HIG_EVENT           RK_EVENT_04



/* task handles */
#define TEMPERATURE_TASK         tempCtl
#define PRESSURE_TASK            pressCt
#define HUM_TASK                 humCtl


VOID SupervisorTask(VOID *args)
{
    RK_UNUSEARGS;
    
    while(1)
    
    {
        ULONG gotFlags = 0UL;

        RK_ERR err = kTaskEventGet(0xFFFF,
                                 RK_FLAGS_ANY,
                                 &gotFlags,
                                 SUPERVISOR_T_PERIOD);
        
        if (err == RK_ERR_SUCCESS && gotFlags != 0) 
        {
                switch (gotFlags) 
                {
                 
                  /* map  events combination to signal handlers */
                  
                  
                
                }
            }
        }

        /* if there is anything to do if time out */        
    }
}
```

Task Events are the only ITC primitive that cannot be disabled; they are a _Core Mechanism_.

[NOTE]
====
RK0 does not implement BSD/UNIX-like asynchronous signals (POSIX style). 

Tasks explicitly wait (`get()`) for bit patterns, and others `set()` bit patterns, making
the scheduler aware of all blocking conditions. 

Thus, unlike traditional asynchronous signal mechanisms (as BSD/UNIX Signals), no code is ever executed at an arbitrary instruction boundary.

=== Semaphore
[width="100%",options="header"]
|===============================
|Semaphore Control Block
|Counter (Unsigned Integer)
|Maximum Value
|Waiting Queue
|===============================

====
A semaphore S is a nonnegative integer variable, apart from the operations it is subjected to. S is initialised to a nonnegative value. The two operations, called P and V, are defined as follows:

`P(S): if S > 0 then S := S-1, else the process is suspended until S > 0.` 

`V(S): if there are processes waiting, then one of them is resumed; else S := S+1.` 

(Dijkstra, 1968)
====

_Semaphores_ are _public_ kernel objects for signalling and waiting on countable events.

`V()` in RK0 semaphores maps to `post()` and `P()` to `pend()`.



===== Counting Semaphore and Binary Semaphores

The typical use case for semaphores is as a "credit tracker": use `pend()` to consume a credit and `post()` to return a credit (for example, free slots in a queue). These are _Counting Semaphores_.

A _Binary Semaphore_ is a counting semaphore with maximum value `1`: the state is either available or unavailable.

Binary semaphores are often used for task-to-task or ISR-to-task synchronisation, and sometimes for mutual exclusion (with caveats discussed later).

===== Semaphores in RK0

To initialise a semaphore in RK0, provide two values: initial count and maximum count. When the counter is at maximum, `post()` does not increment it and returns `RK_ERR_SEMA_FULL`.

A _Binary Semaphore_ is therefore created by setting maximum count to `1`. A counting semaphore that is intended never to saturate can use `UINT32_MAX`.

Besides `init()`, `post()`, and `pend()`, `query()` inspects current state: non-negative means current count; negative means number of tasks waiting.


[#flushing]
==== Flushing or Broadcast

A `flush()` is a _broadcast_ signal: it releases all tasks currently pending on the semaphore. If successful, the semaphore counter remains `0`.


[WARNING]
Flushing/broadcasting must be used with care. Releasing many tasks at once can increase scheduling pressure and hurt response time.

Flushing is allowed from ISRs but you should have a good reason. Nevertheless,
they are deferred to the _PostProcSysTask_ - so they will happen asynchronously.

[#boundedbufsol]
====== Bounded Buffer with Semaphores

Items are buffered within a memory region whose capacity is `K` items.

Thus:  `0  [underline]#<#  (Number of Inserted) – (Number of Extracted) [underline]#<#  K`.

Using semaphores the pattern is as follows:

. A semaphore with `K` tokens to track free slots, preventing producers from proceeding when there are no free slots.
. Another semaphore, with `K` tokens, for the number of items, not allowing consumers to proceed if there are no items.
. A 1-token semaphore so only one task manipulates the buffer at a time.


```C 
/* a ring buffer of items */
#define BUFSIZ (K)
static ITEM_t buf[BUFSIZ]={0};
static UINT getIdx = 0U;
static UINT putIdx = 0U;
/* this indexes==0 could either mean FULL or EMPTY for a regular
circular buffer with wrap-around.
With semaphores the state is well defined.
*/

RK_SEMAPHORE  itemSema;
RK_SEMAPHORE  slotSema;
RK_SEMAPHORE  acquireSema;


VOID kApplicationInit(VOID)
{

  /*buffer is initialised empty */
    kSemaphoreInit
    (   &itemSema,  
        0,   /* no item  */
        K    /*max items */
    ); 
    
    kSemaphoreInit
    (   &slotSema, 
        K, /* K free slots */
        K  /* max slots */
    ); 
    
    /* and free */
    kSemaphoreInit
    (   &acquireSema, 
        1, /* free to access */ 
        1  /* 1 max task allowed */
    ); 

 
VOID PutItem(ITEM_t* insertItemPtr)
{
    /* wait for room */
    kSemaphorePend(&slotSema, RK_WAIT_FOREVER);
    
    /* wait for availability */
    
    kSemaphorePend(&acquireSema,  RK_WAIT_FOREVER);
    buf[putIdx] = *insertItemPtr;
    putIdx += 1U; putIdx %= BUFSIZ;
    /* signal availability */
    kSemaphorePost(&acquireSema);

    /* signal item */
    kSemaphorePost(&itemSema);
}


 VOID GetItem(ITEM_t* extractItemPtr )
{

    /* wait for an item */
    kSemaphorePend(&item, RK_WAIT_FOREVER);
    
    /* wait for availability */
    kSemaphorePend(&acquireSema,  RK_WAIT_FOREVER);
    
    *extractItemPtr = buf[getIdx];
    getIdx+=1U; getIdx %= BUFSIZ;

    /* signal availability */
    kSemaphorePost(&acquireSema);
 
    /* signal room */
    kSemaphorePost(&slotSema);
}

```

_The solution above has Put() and Get() as blocking methods._ 

_If the producer and the consumer run at different rates,  eventually, they will synchronise to the lowest rate._

_The numbers below are from a run with a buffer of 32 items (integers being incremented are the produced data)._ 

_The producer is twice faster than the consumer. Initially at every 2 insertions there is a single remove. Eventually, the buffer is filled up, and tasks run at lockstep (put, get, put, get...), at the consumer pace:_

[#mutex]
==== Mutex Semaphore (Locks)

[width="100%",options="header"]
|===============================
|Mutex Control Block
|Locked State (Boolean)
|Owner
|Protocol Flag (`RK_NO_INHERIT` / `RK_INHERIT`)
|Waiting Queue
|Mutex Node (list node within the owner TCB)
|===============================


Some regions are critical and must not be executed by more than one task at once. Acquiring (`lock()`) a mutex before entering and releasing (`unlock()`) after leaving makes the region mutually exclusive.

A _Mutex_ is a binary semaphore with ownership: once a task locks a mutex only that task can unlock it.

If a task tries to acquire a locked mutex, it switches to `BLOCKED` until the owner unlocks it. When released, the highest-priority waiter is dequeued first. 
Unlike semaphores, unlocking by a non-owner is invalid and rejected.

Mutexes are only for mutual exclusion; they are not signalling primitives.

_PS: RK0 mutexes are non-recursive. Re-entrant locking of the same mutex returns `RK_ERR_MUTEX_REC_LOCK` and is considered a fault._


---

===== Priority Inversion and PIP


Let TH, TM, and TL be three tasks with priority high (H), medium (M) and low (L), respectively. Say TH is dispatched and blocks on a mutex that 'TL' has acquired (i.e.: _"TL is blocking TH_"). 

If 'TM' does not need the resource, it will run and preempt 'TL'. And, by transition, 'TH'.

From now on, 'TH' has an _unbounded waiting time_ because any task with priority higher than 'L' that does not need the resource indirectly prevents it from being unblocked -- _awful._

The Priority Inheritance (PI) Protocol avoids this unbounded waiting. It is characterised by an invariant, simply put:

====
PIP Invariant:
_At any instant a Task assumes the highest priority among  the tasks it is blocking_.
====

If employed on the situation described above, task TM cannot preempt TL, whose effective priority would have been raised to 'H'.

It is straightforward to reason about this when you consider the scenario of a single mutex.

When locks nest, the protocol also needs to be:

- Transitive: if T1 blocks T2 and T2 blocks T3, the highest priority (T3) must propagate back to T1 through T2.

This is the hard part of a correct implementation: updates must preserve the invariant across changing wait chains and multiple mutexes.

[TIP]
====
This blog shows an even more intricate case of priority inversion handling.

Importantly, the worst-case time is bounded by the time the lowest priority task holds a lock (60 ms in the example: 14720ms → 14780ms).

As for each priority update we check each waiting queue for each mutex a task owns, t he time-complexity is linear `O(owner*mutex)`. But, typically no task ever holds more than a few mutexes. Yet, one should not be encouraged to nest locks if not needed.


==== Mutexes vs Binary Semaphores

There is (or used to be) a lot of fuss about whether binary semaphores are appropriate to use as locks. As a practical guideline, if all tasks sharing the resource have the same priority, using a binary semaphore _can be appropriate_ -- because a binary semaphore is considerably faster. It all depends on the case.

The drawback is the lack of ownership: any task can accidentally release the resource. On a large codebase, this can become a real problem. Nonetheless, this is a problem for semaphores in general.

For tasks with different priorities, binary semaphores should never be considered for mutual exclusion unless priority inversion is not a problem (how?).

Counting semaphores initialised as 1 is too risky. Besides the priority inversion, if the count ever increases above 1, mutual exclusion is lost, and multiple tasks can enter the critical section at once.
 

=== Scheduler Lock

Often, we need a task to perform operations without being preempted. A mutex serialises access to a code region but does not prevent a task from being preempted while operating on data. Depending on the case, this can lead to inconsistent data state.

An aggressive way is to disable interrupts globally. For kernel services often it is the only way to keep data integrity. On the higher level it is feasible for very short operations and/or when you need to protect data from interrupts altogether. 

A less aggressive approach is to make the task non-preemptible with `kSchLock()` before entering the critical region and `kSchUnlock()` when leaving. This way, interrupts are still being sensed, and even higher-priority tasks might switch to a ready state, but the running thread will not be preempted. 

The priority inversion it potentially causes is bounded. If a higher-priority task is readied while the scheduler is locked, the context switch happens immediately after unlocking.

Note that for locking/unlocking the scheduler the global interrupts will be disabled for the time to increment/decrement a counter, therefore, if your atomic operation is as short as that (3 to 4 cycles), disabling/enabling global interrupts is a better alternative.

---
_To add to the discussion, when two threads need to access the same data to 'read-modify-write', a lock-free mechanism is the LDREX/STREX operations of ARMv7M (or more generally C11 atomics). They do not avoid preemptions, and particularly in ARMv7m, if the data is touched by an ISR before the store-exclusive concludes, the ownership is lost. Typically used for multi-core spin-locking._

=== Sleep Queue
[width="100%",options="header"]
|===============================
|Sleep Queue Control Block
|Task Waiting Queue 
|===============================

`RK_SLEEP_QUEUE` is a queue of tasks sleeping until explicitly woken. This conceptually the crudest primitive for coordinating the state of tasks in _RK0_. 
.

An _RK_SLEEP_QUEUE_ is stateless: it does not record whether an event has happened. Therefore a `wait()` always puts the caller to sleep. `RK_NO_WAIT` is effectively a no-op on this primitive. A `signal() wakes one waiter (highest priority first). `wake(n)` wakes at most `n` tasks if any. If `n==0` it is a `flush()` -- waking all tasks. If broadcasting from an ISR, the operation is deferred for the _PostProcessingTask_.

A `query()`  returns the number of waiting tasks.
A `suspend()`  move a `READY` task a sleep queue as `SLEEPING_SUSPENDED`. Tasks in other states are not allowed as target. A
`ready()` does the opposite, moving a specific task from that sleep queue to `READY`.

This primitive was formerly named `RK_EVENT`. Sleep Queue names usually reflect the _condition_ they need or the _action_ a sensed wake/signal event triggers. (for example, `notFull`, `notEmpty`, `goWriters`, `goReaders`)

---

__Because Sleep Queues are stateless, they are prone to lost wake-ups when used alone. They are best used as building blocks for _Conditional Critical Regions_ (monitor-like constructs).__ 

---

=== Conditional Critical Regions


Task Events and semaphores work by atomically updating state and testing predicates that control execution flow (for example, `pend` on a semaphore with count `0` blocks the caller).

A critical region guarded by a lock is either free or taken.  
What if we need to wait on a richer condition?

We can combine a Mutex and a Sleep Queue, but there is an important detail: operations on both must be coordinated atomically.

When that combination is wrapped as data plus methods, it is a _Monitor_.

[#monitorinvariant]
==== Monitor Invariants

. a single task can be active within a monitor; 

. only the active task within a monitor can check or change its state. 
 
Since tasks signal or sleep _within_ a monitor based on its _internal_ state, and only one task can be active, we need to establish how to keep both invariants true.
  

==== Signalling Discipline

At any moment a single task can be active within a monitor. When the sleeping task is signalled, there are 3 common disciplines to follow: signal-and-leave (Hansen), signal-and-wait (Hoare) or signal-and-continue (Mesa). 

Arguably, the most common is _signal-and-continue_ - rather than leaving or suspending itself the active task might continue within the monitor.
That is possible if the active task holds a lock the waking task needs to acquire to enter. Upon leaving, the active task must release the lock.

The major implication is that by the time the woken task enters the monitor, the condition it was waiting for might no longer be true. 
It sounds odd because a Monitor is about encapsulating a conditional critical region so no outsiders change its state. But, either a flush, a bad design -- or a preemption anomaly -- can violate that somehow. 


Mesa Monitor has a typical test-loop pattern: 

```
 --- snippet ---
 while (condition.isFalse())  
 { 
    /*unlock-wait sequence:*/
     DISABLE_PREEMPTION
     unlock(mutex);
     sleep(condition)
     ENABLE_PREEMPTION
     lock(mutex);
     /* when waking, the while clause is tested again */
 } 
 --- snippet ---
```

The figure below shows a producer-consumer problem if implemented 
on a Monitor-idiom.
```

      

                            Entry Queue [][][]–>
         .............................................
         -------------------     
         | Internal Data   |   
         -------------------  |[Active Task]|     
         | Sleep Queues    |  
         |Sleeping for Data|
         |Sleeping for Room|
         -------------------      
                              -> [][][] Exit Queue
        ...............................................
           
```

The `UNLOCK-SLEEP` sequence within the testing loop has preemption disabled because after releasing the lock, the task cannot be allowed to resume within the monitor again, for any reason that is not the monitor predicate being satisfied.

==== Condition Variable Model 

The _Condition Variable Model_ allows a task to wait within a monitor-construct and if active, operate using `signal()`, `wait()` and `broadcast()` respecting the monitor invariant.

_Sleep Queues_ are actually the canonical _Condition Variable_ introduced by Hoare:

====
_Note that a condition "variable" is neither true nor
false; indeed, it does not have any stored value accessible
to the program. In practice, a condition variable will be
represented by an (initially empty) queue of processes
which are currently waiting on the condition; but this
queue is invisible both to waiters and signallers. This
design of the condition variable has been deliberately
kept as primitive and rudimentary as possible (...)_

(_Monitors: An Operating System Structuring Concept, Hoare, 1974_)
====



_RK0_ follows _pthreads condition variable_ semantics, aligned with Mesa monitors.

The difference is that there is no standalone _CondVar_ primitive. The programmer combines Sleep Queues and Mutexes and uses these helpers:

- `kCondVarWait(&sleepq, &mutex, timeout)` 
- `kCondVarSignal(&sleepq)` 
- `kCondVarBroadcast(&sleepq)` 

The `condWait` is the real helper. When using it, a Mesa testing-loop reduces to:

```

  while(!condition)
  {
    kCondVarWait(&condQueue, &monitorLock, timeout);
  }
  

```  

If you need a monitor policy different from Mesa, you can build it from the same primitives.

[NOTE]
`kCondVarWait`, `kCondVarSignal`, and `kCondVarBroadcast` are task-context APIs and cannot be called from ISRs.


===== Usage Example: Synchronisation Barrier

A given number of tasks must reach a point in the program before _all can proceed_, so every task calls a `barrWait(&barrier)` to catch up with the set of tasks it must synchronise. 

The last task entering the barrier will broadcast a signal to all tasks waiting for the wake condition.
 
At any moment within a Monitor a single task is RUNNING (what is an invariant of the kernel), all other tasks within the monitor are either SLEEPING (for some condition) or BLOCKED (on a mutex). 


```C

/* Synchronisation Barrier */

typedef struct 
{
    RK_MUTEX lock;
    RK_SLEEP_QUEUE allSynch;
    UINT count; /* number of tasks in the barrier */
    UINT round; /* increased every time all tasks synch */
    UINT nRequired; /* number of tasks required */
} Barrier_t;

    barPtr->count = 0;
    barPtr->round = 0;
    barPtr->nRequired = nRequired;
    
}

VOID BarrierWait(Barrier_t *const barPtr)
{
    UINT myRound = 0;
    kMutexLock(&barPtr->lock, RK_WAIT_FOREVER);
  
    /* save round number */
    myRound = barPtr->round;
    /* increase count on this round */
    barPtr->count++;

    if (barPtr->count == barPtr->nRequired) 
    {
        /* reset counter, inc round, broadcast to sleeping tasks */
        barPtr->round++;
        barPtr->count = 0; 
        kCondVarBroadcast(&barPtr->allSynch);  
    } 
    else 
    {
        /* sequence: a proper wake signal might happen after inc round */
        while ((UINT)(barPtr->round - myRound) == 0U)
        {
            RK_ERR err = kCondVarWait(&barPtr->allSynch, &barPtr->lock, RK_WAIT_FOREVER);
            K_ASSERT(err==RK_ERR_SUCCESS);
        }
    }
    kMutexUnlock(&barPtr->lock);
}


#define N_REQUIRED 3

Barrier_t syncBarrier;

VOID kApplicationInit(VOID)
{
	
    K_ASSERT(!kCreateTask(&task1Handle, Task1, RK_NO_ARGS, "Task1", stack1, STACKSIZE, 2, RK_PREEMPT));
    K_ASSERT(!kCreateTask(&task2Handle, Task2, RK_NO_ARGS, "Task2", stack2, STACKSIZE, 3, RK_PREEMPT));
    K_ASSERT(!kCreateTask(&task3Handle, Task3, RK_NO_ARGS, "Task3", stack3, STACKSIZE, 1, RK_PREEMPT));
	BarrierInit(&syncBarrier, N_REQUIRED);
}

    {
        kPuts("Task 1 is waiting at the barrier...\r\n");
        BarrierWait(&syncBarrier);
        kPuts("Task 1 passed the barrier!\r\n");
		kSleep(8);
    }
}

VOID Task2(VOID* args)
{
    RK_UNUSEARGS
    while (1)
    {
        kPuts("Task 2 is waiting at the barrier...\r\n");
        BarrierWait(&syncBarrier);

		kSleep(5);
	}
}

VOID Task3(VOID* args)
{

    {
        kPuts("Task 3 is waiting at the barrier...\r\n");
        BarrierWait(&syncBarrier);
        kPuts("Task 3 passed the barrier!\r\n");
        kSleep(3);
	}
}


```

[NOTE]
Monitor/CondVars are not to be signalled by ISRs. Because as they do not accumulate and an ISR is not a normal task, it can't be within a monitor and a signal might be lost.


[#readerswriterslock]
===== Usage Example: Readers Writers Lock

Several readers and writers share a piece of memory. Readers can concurrently access the memory to read; a single writer is allowed (otherwise, data would be corrupted). 

When a writer finishes, it checks for any readers waiting. If there is, the writer flushes the readers waiting queue. If not, it wakes a single writer, if any.
When the last reader finishes, it signals a writer.

Every read or write operation begins with an acquire and finishes with a release.

_PS: This RWLock implementation has a *reader-preference* policy, as when a writer finishes, it flushes sleeping readers. 
When the last reader finishes, it will signal writer waiting queue._


```C

/* RW-Lock */

/* a single writer is allowed if there are no readers */

	{

	    /* mutex is locked when waking up*/
	}
	/* woke here, set an active writer */
	rwLockPtr->rwCount = -1;
	kMutexUnlock(&rwLockPtr->lock);
}

/* a writer releases, waking up all waiting readers, if any */
/* if there are no readers, a writer can get in */
VOID RwLockReleaseWrite(RwLock_t *const rwLockPtr)
{

	}
	else

	    /* mutex is locked when waking up*/
	}
	/* increase rwCount, so its > 0, indicating readers */
	rwLockPtr->rwCount ++;
	kMutexUnlock(&rwLockPtr->lock);
}

/* a reader releases and wakes a single writer */ 
/* if it is the last reader */

=== Message Queue

The key mechanism for Message Passing in _RK0_ is a _Message Queue_. Messages are passed _by copy_ and have a fixed-size of 4-,8-,16- or 32-byte, i.e., 1, 2, 4 or 8 words. 

Two other abstractions are constructed on top of Queues:

. _Port_, which is a server endpoint that enqueues _Remote Invocations_, or _Procedure Calls_ from clients.

. _Mailbox_, a 1-word message queue. It can be used as is, and is used by the kernel as reply route from servers to clients.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|===============================
|Message Queue Control Block 
|Buffer Address
|Message Size 
|Number of Mesages 
|Write Position
|Read Position
|Server Status
|Owner Task
|Notify callback
|Waiting queue
|===============================
 
==== Size of a Message 

Each declared queue has a _fixed message-size_ at initialisation, and can assume, 1, 2, 4 or 8 WORDs (4, 8, 16, 32 BYTEs). This constraint is intentional. Word-aligned copies are faster, predictable and safer for type casting.

(A word-aligned _single copy_ will take ~5 cycles in Cortex-M3/4/7, and ~6 cycles on Cortex-M0/M0+.)

_Ports_ have messages whose types are labeled as:

- `RK_PORT_MESG_<2,4,8>WORD`, which the first two are reserved meta-data. For variable payload one uses the `RK_PORT_MESG_COOKIE`, passing an opaque spointer as payload.

==== Blocking and non-blocking behaviour

A producer task can optionally block on a full queue, switching its state to `SENDING`. A consumer (optionally) blocks on an empty queue switching its state to `RECEIVING`. 

Note that when using non-blocking calls `(RK_NO_WAIT`) they immediately return if unsuccessful. 

One can use a `peek()` to read from the head of a queue without extracting the message. A `jam()` method is used to put a message on the queue head, but it does not overwrite. `jam()` is meaningless for Mailboxes.

A `postovw()` overwrites the oldest message and is allowed solely for 1-message queues. If N-message queues were allowed to be overwritten, all unread messages would leak as read and write pointers are adjusted on the operation. In case one needs overwriting full queues continuously a classic ring buffer will do.

`peek()` and `postovw()` are normally used on Mailboxes for last-message semantics -- the Mailbox never goes empty; a new message is placed by overwriting the current one.

==== Ownership and Priority Inversion

Message Queues (and by extension, Mailboxes) _can_ have owners, and thus, only the owners can receive at these channels. One might think it makes it a _Port_, but not yet. The fact is, if a receiver is blocked on full queue, the sender can boost its priority.

_Ports_ are for _ synchronous procedure calls_. The server needs to run at the client's priority, which means either boosting or demoting priority.
   
==== Notify callback

A callback can be registered for when a queue sends a message successfuly, as a means of event notification.

==== Usage Examples

Below there is a rich set of usage examples. They demonstrate how to use message-passing in RK0, its API and helper macros to declare storage and messages at the appropriate size.

===== Mail Queue pattern

In RTOS jargon, a _Mailbox_ is often regarded as a 1-slot queue. The size can vary but a commonly it is a pointer-sized message `(sizeof(VOID*))`. 

When exchanging messages which carry data to be parsed, for instance:

```
DATA STRUCT:
[COMMAND ID]
[PAYLOAD SIZE]
[PAYLOAD]
[CRC]
```

On the _Mail Queue_ pattern, a buffer is allocated, filled and sent through the message queue by a producer.

A consumer dequeues, use data (may copy it locally or not) and when done deallocate it.

This _producer-allocates/consumer-deallocates_ contract, guarantees data integrity on the reference. On practice, we are _moving_ data between threads. 

If we are talking of messages bigger than 1-word, without the allocator we might either copy twice sender->queue buffer->receiver or handing off references with no explicit contract for keeping data scope.

A Mail Queue pattern is used on the Application Logger facility that happens
to use several non-blocking senders to a single blocking-receiver, aligned to the Active Object design pattern.


```C
/* Application Logger pattern */

/* standard log structure */
struct log
{
    RK_TICK t; /* timestamp */
    CHAR s[LOGLEN]; /*formatted string */
    UINT    level; /* level 0=message, 1=fault */
} K_ALIGN(4);

typedef struct log Log_t;

/* logger mem allocator + mem pool */
static RK_MEM_PARTITION qMem;
static Log_t logBufPool[LOGPOOLSIZ] K_ALIGN(4);

/* backing buffer for the logger queue */
/* (messages are 1-word-size, number equals the pool) */
RK_DECLARE_MESG_QUEUE_BUF(logQBuf, VOID *, LOGPOOLSIZ)

/* logger mail queue */
static RK_MESG_QUEUE logQ;

/* a sender will allocate a buffer write the log
message and enqueue on the mail queue, not-blocking 
if the queue is full it returns the buffer immediately
if the memory pool is empty it drops the operation */

```c
/* excerpt of logPost(...) */
VOID logPost(/*formatted string */)
    ---snip---
    Log_t *logPtr = (Log_t*)kMemPartitionAlloc(&qMem);
    RK_BARRIER
    if (logPtr) /* available buffer */
    {
      
       < fill the buffer >

        /* enqueue address */
        if (kMesgQueueSend(&logQ, &p, RK_NO_WAIT) != RK_ERR_SUCCESS)
        {
            /* queue is full, deallocate buf */
            RK_ERR err = kMemPartitionFree(&qMem, &p);
            K_ASSERT(err==RK_ERR_SUCCESS);
        }

    }
    ---snip---

/* excerpt of the logger task */

static VOID LoggerTask(VOID *args)
{
    RK_UNUSEARGS
    while (1)
    {

        VOID *recvPtr = NULL;
        
        /* drain the queue: keep receiving while successful */
        while (kMesgQueueRecv(&logQ, &recvPtr, RK_WAIT_FOREVER) == RK_ERR_SUCCESS)
        {  
            < print buffer contents >  
            
            /* deallocate */
            RK_ERR err = kMemPartitionFree(&qMem, recvPtr);
            K_ASSERT(err == RK_ERR_SUCCESS);

        }
    }
}



```
This is one of the many ways of using the Mail Queue pattern. 

The entire implementation can be seen at `app\logger.c`.


===== Averaging Sensor Values 

A task receives measured sensor values from an ISR on a periodic rate. (A Soft Timer emulates the ISR).

Then it enqueues this data to a consumer - that will process the average value for each of 4 sensors.

The inter-task communication is designed as follows:

. The producer pends on a Mailbox that an ISR posts to. An application timer emulates this ISR.

. The data extracted from the Mailbox is placed in a queue with the processing task as the consumer. 

. As the producer's priority must be higher than that of the consumer, eventually, the queue will get full. 

. The producer drops the last message when the queue is full and signals the consumer. 

. Now the consumer has a batch of data to work until the next sensor update. It will block (pend on a signal) whenever the queue is empty.

===== Queue Select using Notify Callback

A task is receiving from many queues and need to know which one has been able to complete.  

The `notifyCbk(queue*)` is executed every time a send is successful. In this case it is using an Event Signal to a task. The Signals Flag indicate the queue number - as a contract - of which queue has completed sends. Note that as sends may coalesce, while a flag caps at 1, the consumer will drain each queue until it is empty, or it is preempted.

=====  Synchronous Client-Server Procedure Call

The example below computes a CRC on the server for the client’s payload and returns it as the reply code. Logically, this is unbuffered: the client blocks until it receives the reply.

For `kPortSendRecv()`, each client task must pass the address of a Mailbox to store the client response (4-byte). 

Note that the server may temporarily adopt the client priority while serving the request. After `kPortReplyDone()`, it returns to nominal priority.

[TIP]
====
There is little practical difference between a message that does not arrive and one with no valid (stale) data. But when wrong (or stale) data is processed - e.g., to define a set point on a loop - a system can fail badly.

Design Choice: provide a broadcast asynchronous message-passing scheme that guarantees data freshness and integrity for all readers. 

Benefits: The system has a mechanism to meet strict deadlines that cannot be predicted on design time.
====

Control loops reacting to unpredictable time events—like a robot scanning an environment or a drive-by-wire system—require a different message-passing approach. Readers cannot "look at the past" and cannot block. The most recent data must be delivered lock-free and have guaranteed integrity. 

As _Ports_, the _MRM_ is a high-level mechanism. It was chosen to be provided as a kernel service, given its distinctive nature and suitability for _RK0_ applications.

==== Functional Description

An _MRM_ works as a _1-to-many asynchronous Mailbox_ - with a lock-free specialisation that enables several readers to get the most recent deposited message with no integrity issues. Whenever a reader reads an MRM buffer, it will find the most recent data transmitted. It can also be seen as an extension of the Double Buffer pattern for a 1:N communication.

The core idea of the MRM protocol is that readers can only access the buffer that is classified as the '_most recent buffer_'. After a writer _publish()_ a message, that will be the only message readers can _get()_ -- any former message being processed by a reader was grabbed _before_ a new _publish()_ - and, from now on, can only be _unget()_, eventually returning to the pool.

To clarify further, the communication steps are listed:

. A producer first reserves an MRM Buffer - the reserved MRM Buffer is not available for reading until it is published.

. A message buffer is allocated and filled, and its address is within an MRM Buffer. The producer _publishes_ the message. From now on, it is _the most recent message_. Any former published buffer is no longer visible to new readers

. A reader starts by _getting_ an MRM Buffer.  A `get()` operation delivers a copy of the message to the reader's scope. Importantly, this operation increases the number of readers associated to that MRM Buffer. 

Before ending its cycle, the task releases (`unget()`) the buffer; on releasing, the kernel checks if the caller task is the last reader and if the buffer being released is not the current MRM Buffer. 

If the above conditions are met, the `unget()` operation will return the MRM buffer to the pool. If there are more readers, OR if it is the current buffer, it remains available. 

When the `reserve` operation detects that the most recent buffer still has readers, a new buffer is allocated to be written and published. If it has no readers, it is reused. 

This way, the worst case is a sequence of `publish()` with no `unget()` at all -- this would lead to the writer finding no buffer to reserve. This is prevented by making: `N Buffers = N tasks + 1`.  

==== MRM Control Block Configuration


What might lead to some confusion when initialising an MRM Control Block is the need for two different pools:

- One pool will be the storage for the MRM Buffers, which is the data structure for the mechanism.

- Another pool is for the actual payload. The messages.

Both pools must have the same number of elements: the number of tasks communicating + 1. 

- The size of the data buffers is application-dependent - and is passed as a number of _words_. The minimal message size is 32-bit. 

- If using data structures, keep it aligned to 4 to take advantage of the performance of aligned memory.


==== Usage Example

Consider a modern car - speed variations are of interest in many modules. With a somehow "naive" approach, let us consider three modules and how they should react when speed varies:

. *Cruiser Control:* For the Cruiser Control, a speed increase might signify the driver wants manual control back, and it will likely turn off.

. *Windshield Wipers:* If they are on, a speed change can affect the electric motor's adjustments to the air resistance.

. *Radio:* Speed changes reflect the aerodynamic noise - the radio volume might need adjustment.

As the variations are unpredictable, we need a mechanism to deliver the last speed in order of importance for all these modules. From highest to lowest priority, Cruise, Wipers, and Radio are the three modules that range from safety to comfort.

To emulate this scenario, we can write an application with a higher priority task that sleeps and wakes up at pseudo-random times to produce random values that represent the (unpredictable) speed changes.

The snippet below has 4 periodic tasks. Tasks are periodic using the `kSleepRelease()` primitive.

There is a sequential counter. When a task wakes and see it was not incremented it just runs.

The producer publishes new data at a random interval, preempting whatever task is running at the moment. Given tha random updates,

Thus, different situations can happen:

- All tasks read the updated pair (speed, time)
- Not all tasks receive the updated pair because another update happens in between.
- No tasks receive an update - because another happens too soon.
- No update happens between in the period of a given task. It receives
the same value. No problems.


All these cases are on the log:

_The highlight is that controllers can keep their pace, while receiving fresh data - you can see it on the timestamp on the image._ 

Again, they might receive the same data more than once or miss samples; what is important is that _they are not lagging and consuming stale data._

== __**Error Handling**__

=== Fail fast

While tracing and error handling are yet to be largely improved (and that is when the 1.0.0 version will be released), currently
_RK0_ employs a policy of _failing fast_ in *debug mode*. 

When Error Checking is enabled, every kernel call will be 'defensive', checking for correctness of parameters and invariants, null dereferences, etc. 

In these cases is more useful to allow the first error to halt the execution by calling an Error Handler function to observe the program state.

A trace structure records the address of the running TCB, its current stack pointer, the link register (that is, the PC at kErrHandler was called), and a time stamp.

This record is on a `.noinit` RAM section, so it is visible if CPU resets. A fault code is stored in a global `faultID` and on the trace structure.
Developers can hook in custom behaviour.

If the kernel is configured to not halt on a fault, but Error Checking is enabled, functions will return negative values in case of an error.

On the other hand, when Error Checking is disabled or `NDEBUG` is defined nothing is checked, reducing code size and improving performance. 

(_Some deeper internal calls have assertion. For those, only `NDEBUG` defined ensures they are disabled._)

=== Stack Overflow

Stack overflow is detected (not prevented) using a "stack painting" with a sentinel word. Stack Overflow detection is enabled by defining the assembler preprocessor `__KDEF_STACKOVFLW` when compiling.


As a matter of fact, sizing your stack is something you must do diligently when programming a system. I would say a mechanism for stack overflow detection is on the bottom of the list of 'must-have' features. 

One can take advantage of the static task model - _it is possible to predict offline_ the deepest call within any task. The compiler flag `-fstack-usage` creates `.su` files indicating the depth of every function within a module. This is an example of compilation-unit output:

```
core/src/ksema.c:34:8:kSemaphoreInit	88	static
core/src/ksema.c:74:8:kSemaphorePend	96	static
core/src/ksema.c:189:8:kSemaphorePost	88	static
core/src/ksema.c:265:8:kSemaphoreFlush	72	static
core/src/ksema.c:306:5:kSemaphoreQuery	40	static
core/src/kmutex.c:128:8:kMutexInit	16	static
core/src/kmutex.c:165:8:kMutexLock	120	static
core/src/kmutex.c:325:8:kMutexUnlock	96	static
core/src/kmutex.c:425:6:kMutexQuery	56	static
```

These are the worst cases. Now, you identify the depth of the longest _chain of calls_ for a task using these services and add a generous safety margin -- 30%. The cap depends on your budget.

Importantly, you also have to size the System Stack. This initial size is defined in `linker.ld` by the symbol `Min_Stack_Size`. In this case, account for the depth of `main()`, `kApplicationInit()`, and all interrupt handlers; again, inspect the longest call chain depth. Assume interrupts always add to the worst static depth, and account for _nested interrupts_.

=== Deadlocks

There are deadlock-recovery techniques in the literature, but they are generally unfeasible here. The kernel provides bounded waiting, enforces priority-ordered waiting queues, applies mutex priority inheritance, and offers lock-free primitives and period-drift compensation. None of these techniques prevents deadlocks by itself (and with bounded blocking plus lock-free primitives, one can still get _livelocks_).


- Ordered Locking:

For those programming the application, despite following the RMS rule of higher priority for higher request rate tasks, the golden rule for locking is acquiring resources in an unidirectional order _throughout the entire application_:
``` 
acquire(A);
acquire(B);
acquire(C);
   .
   .
   .
release(C);
release(B);
release(A);



```


This breaks circular waiting.

For instance:

``` 

TaskA:
   wait(R1);
   wait(R2);
    /* critical section */
   signal(R2);
   signal(R1);

TaskB:
   wait(R1);
   wait(R2);
    /* critical section */
   signal(R2);
   signal(R1);


``` 
But, if:

```
TaskA:
    wait(R1);
    wait(R2);
    .
    .
    
TaskB:
    wait(R2);
    wait(R1);
    .
    .
``` 

There are some possible outcomes:

. Deadlock: 

- TaskA runs: acquires R1
- TaskB runs: acquires R2
- TaskA runs: tries to acquire R2 — blocked
- TaskB runs: tries to acquire R1 — blocked

. No deadlock:

- TaskA runs: acquires R1

- TaskA runs: acquires R2 (nobody is holding R2)

- TaskA releases both; TaskB runs and acquires both (in either order)


Overall, there is no deadlock if tasks do not overlap in critical sections. That is why systems run for years without deadlocks and eventually: _ploft_.


- Use a 'master-lock' with 'try' semantics:

Another technique that can be employed is if one needs to acquire multiple locks—acquire them all or none using a try-lock (`RK_NO_WAIT`). If any of the tries fail, the task gives up on acquiring the resources and backs off, releasing all successful locks to retry later (most simply, using a sleep queue). That is easier said than done, though, and, as mentioned, if not well done, instead of deadlocks, one gets livelocks.

(_Livelocks_ are when a couple of tasks keep running, but the program does not advance.)


== __**RK0 Services API**__

=== Convention

- A kernel call starts with a lowercase `k`. Typically it is followed by a kernel object identifier and an action. 

```c
kSemaphorePend(&sema, 800); /* pend on a semaphore; 800 ticks time-out */
``` 

- When `k` is followed by an action, it is acting on the caller task. 

```c
kSleep(150); /* sleep the caller task for 150 ticks */
``` 

- Some calls can act either on the caller or on another task:

```C 
/* stores the signal flags of the task identified by task1Handle on queryValue */
kTaskEventQuery(task1Handle, &queryValue); 

/* retrieves its own signal flags */
kTaskEventQuery(NULL, &queryValue); 

``` 
=== Return Values

With a few exceptions, kernel calls return a `RK_ERR` error code. `0` is a successful operation `(RK_ERR_SUCCESS)` and any negative value is an error that indicates failure. 
A positive value is an unsuccessful operation, but will not lead the system to failure (e.g., any unsuccessful `try` operation).
