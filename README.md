## Know it

**RK*0*** is a lean, feature-rich, highly deterministic Real-Time Kernel for deeply embedded solutions.

> - See the [**RK*0* Docbook**](https://antoniogiacomelli.github.io/RK0/) for a thorough design description and usage examples.
> - Check the [**RK*0* Blog**](https://kernel0.org/blog) for some quick reads.

 _Supported Architectures_: **ARMv6M (Cortex-M0/0+) and ARMv7M (Cortex-M3/4/7)**.

## Use it

> - [**Emulated hardware**](https://github.com/antoniogiacomelli/RK0/wiki/RK0-%E2%80%90-Running-on-QEMU): the provided Makefile targets QEMU

## System Architecture

If no more details are to be provided, the kernel has a top and a bottom layer. On the top, the Executive manages the resources needed by the application. On the bottom, the Low-level Scheduler works as a software extension of the CPU. Together, they implement the Task abstraction â€” the Concurrency Unit that enables a multitasking environment.

In systems design jargon, the Executive enforces policy (what should happen). The Low-level Scheduler provides the mechanism (how it gets done). The services are the primitives that transform policy decisions into concrete actions executed by the Scheduler.

 ## Features (V0.6.2-dev) 
 - Priority Preemptive Scheduler:
   (Low-latency, O(1): 4Â¹ CPU cycles pick-next algorithm)
 - Inter-Task Communication: rich set of mechanisms, designed with different best-use cases in mind
 - High-precision application timers
 - Efficient fixed-size Memory Allocator (Memory Pools)
 - FPU support
 - FootprintÂ² is ~2.5KiB ROM (core features)
 - Highly modular
 - Clean API


_Â¹ On ARMv7M. ARMv6M yields O(1), ~11 cycles_

_Â² Core system, does not account optional services and application size._

## Code Quality 
RK0 source code compiles cleanly with the following GCC flags:

`-Wall -Wextra -Wsign-compare -Wsign-conversion -pedantic`

Static Analysis (Cppcheck)  is clean with no warnings, errors, or style issues.
