## Know it

**RK*0*** is a lean, feature-rich, highly deterministic Real-Time Kernel for deeply embedded solutions.

> - See the [**RK*0* Docbook**](https://antoniogiacomelli.github.io/RK0/) for a thorough design description and usage examples.
> - Check the [**RK*0* Blog**](https://kernel0.org/blog) for some quick reads.

 _Supported Architectures_: **ARMv6M (Cortex-M0/0+) and ARMv7M (Cortex-M3/4/7)**.


### RK0 Main Features (0.8.0-dev)

- **O(1) Scheduler: priority preemptive (RMS)**

- **Message Passing with Priority Inversion Avoidance**
   - *_Message Queues_* for classic synchronous/asynchronous communication
   - *_Ports_* for synchronous client-server Remote Invocation
  
- **Most-Recent Message Protocol**
  
  - Asynchronous, Lock-Free, purpose-built for Real-time Control Loops
    
- **High-Precision Timers:**
  
   - Minimal Tick Handling overhead for Bounded Waiting, Periodic Sleeps and Application Timers. 


- **Truly Transitive Priority Inheritance for Mutexes:**

  - Handles chained priority inversion scenarios.

- **Highly Modular with clean and consistent API**.

## System Architecture

If no more details are to be provided, the kernel has a top and a bottom layer. On the top, the Executive manages the resources needed by the application. On the bottom, the Low-level Scheduler works as a software extension of the CPU. Together, they implement the Task abstraction — the Concurrency Unit that enables a multitasking environment.

In systems design jargon, the Executive enforces policy (what should happen). The Low-level Scheduler provides the mechanism (how it gets done). The services are the primitives that transform policy decisions into concrete actions executed by the Scheduler.

## Code Quality 
RK0 source code compiles cleanly with the following GCC flags:

`-Wall -Wextra -Wsign-compare -Wsign-conversion -pedantic`

Static Analysis (Cppcheck)  is clean with no warnings, errors, or style issues.
