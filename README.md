## Know it

**RK*0*** is a lean, feature-rich, highly deterministic Real-Time Kernel for deeply embedded solutions.

> - See the [**RK*0* Docbook**](https://antoniogiacomelli.github.io/RK0/) for a thorough design description and usage examples.
> - Check the [**RK*0* Blog**](https://kernel0.org/blog) for some quick reads.

 _Supported Architectures_: **ARMv6M (Cortex-M0/0+) and ARMv7M (Cortex-M3/4/7)**.


### RK0 Main Features (0.8.0-dev)

- _O(1)¹ Scheduler_: priority preemptive (RMS)

- _Truly Transitive Priority Inheritance for Mutexes_:
Handles chained priority inversion scenarios.

- _Mailboxes_: from simple message queues, ownernhip model for priority inheritance, and _Ports_ for Synchronous RPC client-server with priority handling. 

- _Most-Recent Message Protocol_:
Lock-Free, purpose-built for real-time control loops: producers never block, consumers always get the freshest data.

- _High-Precision Timers_:
Minimal Tick Handling overhead for Bounded Waiting, Periodic Sleeps and Application Timers. 

- _Highly Modular with clean and consistent API_.

- _Low Footprint_: 
Less than 3KiB ROM²

_¹ Next-task _Selection_ takes 4 cycles in ARMv7M, ~11 cycles in ARMv6M._
_² Core system, does not account optional services and application size._

## System Architecture

If no more details are to be provided, the kernel has a top and a bottom layer. On the top, the Executive manages the resources needed by the application. On the bottom, the Low-level Scheduler works as a software extension of the CPU. Together, they implement the Task abstraction — the Concurrency Unit that enables a multitasking environment.

In systems design jargon, the Executive enforces policy (what should happen). The Low-level Scheduler provides the mechanism (how it gets done). The services are the primitives that transform policy decisions into concrete actions executed by the Scheduler.

## Code Quality 
RK0 source code compiles cleanly with the following GCC flags:

`-Wall -Wextra -Wsign-compare -Wsign-conversion -pedantic`

Static Analysis (Cppcheck)  is clean with no warnings, errors, or style issues.
